1. JavaScript is a `high level`, `prototype based object oriented`, `multi-paradigm`, `interpreted` or `just-in-time` compiled, `dynamic`, `single-threaded`, `garbage-collected` programming language with `first-class functions` and a `non-blocking event loop` concurrency model.

   a. high-level - JS is a high level language, meaning that it is designed to be easy to use and understand. It is not a low-level language like C or C++. We have to not manually manage memory, but downside is that program will never be as fast or as optimized as C or C++.

   b. garbage-collection - An alogrithm inside the JavaScript engine, which automatically removes old, unused objects from memory.

   c. interpreted or just-in-time compiled - Many programming languages are compiled to machine code, which is then executed by the computer. JavaScript is interpreted, meaning that it is executed line by line, just like a script.

   d. multi-paradigm - An approach and mindset of structuring code in a way that allows for flexibility and adaptability. Three main paradigms are procedural, object-oriented (OOP), and functional programming (FP).

   e. prototype bases object oriented - Almost everthing in JavaScript is an object except for primitives like numbers, strings, and booleans.

   f. first-class functions - Functions are simply treated as variables. We can pass them into other functions, and return them from functions.

   g. dynamic - We don't assign data types to variables. We can change the type of a variable at any time by reassigning it. 

   h. single-threaded - JavaScript is single threaded, meaning that it can only execute one thing at a time.

   i. concurrency model - JavaScript has a concurrency model that allows it to run multiple things at the same time. It uses an event loop to manage the execution of code.
