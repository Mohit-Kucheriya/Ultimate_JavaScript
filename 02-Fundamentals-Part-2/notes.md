1. Strict Mode - By activating, it makes easier to write a secure JavaScript code. It reserves some keywords which might be used in the future i.e. we can't use them as variable names.

2. When we write a function, we also pass data into function and additionally, a function can also return data as well, which means to give us data back.

3. In functions we also specify something called parameters and parameters are like variables that are specific only to that function and they will get defined once we call the function.

4. We can reuse the function with different input values to get different output.

5. Atleast call the function once, because if we never called a function, then the code inside the function will never get executed.

6. Not all functions need to return something and not all functions need to accept parameters.

7. Parameters are simply the placeholder, the data we pass when we call the function get's stored in the parameters.

8. In JavaScript, when a number is combined with a string (such as in a template literal or with the + operator for concatenation), JavaScript implicitly converts the number to a string

9. The difference between a function declaration and a function expression is that we can actually call function declarations before they are defined in the code.

10. In arrow functions, we don't have to write the keyword 'function' before the function name and if we have single parameter, we can omit the parenthesis.

11. In arrow functions, we can omit the curly braces and the return keyword if the function body consists of a single expression, simply called implicit return.

12. When we return anything from a function, after returning, it get's exists immediately i.e. the function will not get executes anymore.

13. Two more important data strutures in JavaScript are Array and Object.

14. Array can hold multiple values and of different types.

15. In Array brackets, we can put any expression i.e anything that can be evaluated to a value.

16. We can actually mutate the array by changing the values of the elements even though they are declared with const, but we simply can't replace the entire array with a new array.

17. Difference between Array and Object, is that in Objects, the order of the values doesn't matter, but in Array, the order matters, when we want to retrieve them.

18. Arrays for more order data, and Objects for more un-structured data.

19. Undefined is what we get, when we try to access a property of an object that doesn't exist.

20. JS gives us access to a special variable called this, which refers to the object itself.

21. 'this' keyword is used to refer to the object that is calling the function or method.
 
22. Arrays are actually also objects, they are just a special kind0 of object and so they have functions, or in other words, they have methods that we can use to manipulate them like push, pop, shift, unshift, splice, etc.

23. While-loop is more versatile than for-loop, because it can be used to execute a block of code as long as a condition is true. But all the while-loop really needs is the condition, which needs to stay true it to keep running. And that condition can be any condition, it doesn't have to be any counter at all.
