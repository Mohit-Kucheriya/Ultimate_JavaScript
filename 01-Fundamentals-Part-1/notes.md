1. JavaScript - JavaScript is a High-level, Object-Oriented, Multi-Paradigm, Programming language
   a. Programming language - Writing code, Simply instructs computer to do things.
   b. High-level - We don't have to worry about complex stuff like memory management.
   c. Object-Oriented - Based on objects, for storing most kinds of data.
   d. Multi-Paradigm - It can be used for writing code in many different ways such as imperative & declarative.

2. To access the console, we need to explicitly say console.log(). Whenever we want to access the developer console. Whenever we need to output something from our code, we use console.log().

3. Value & Variable - A value is a piece of data that can be stored in a variable.
   a. Never give random names to variables.
   b. Variables names cannot start with a number.
   c. Use camelCase for variable names.
   d. Don't use JS reserved words as variable names.
   e. Try to use variables names as descriptive as possible. So that it is easy to understand.

4. In JS every value is either an object or a primitive value. A value is only primitive when it's not an object.

5. JavaScript has a feature called dynamic typing i.e. we don't have to manually define the data type of a variable. It does it automatically, when the value is assigned to the variable.

6. Value has type, NOT variable.

7. Later in the code, we can assign the new value i.e. of different data type to the same variable.

8. If we don't use "" for string, it will be treated as a variable and JS will look for the variable with the same name. So, we need to use "" to make it a string.

9. Remember when we declare a variable first time we use 'let' keyword, later while changing or updating the value we don't use let.

10. Whenever we define an empty variable, the value of the variable is undefined and the typeof that variable will be undefined.

11. Undefine simply means we have declare the variable but haven't assigned any value to it.

12. typeof undefined will return undefined.

13. typeof null will return object.

14. Using const a inital value is required, we just can't declare only the variable name, a value is must.

15. Try to use const for variables that will not change in future and let for variables that can change at any point of time.

16. var is function scope, let is block scope.

17. '+' operator is used for concatenating strings and for adding numbers as well.

18. When we use + operator, it will convert the operands to string if one of the operand is a number and the other is a string.

19. Not always try to log the result, store them in a variable.

20. In if-else statement, else block is optional. Even if don't write it the code will move to the next line.

21. When we have number input field, the numbers which we receive from the user are strings. So we need to convert them to numbers before we can perform any mathematical operation.

22. NaN stands for Not a Number. Invalid number but it still a number somehow.

23. typeof NaN will return 'number'.

24. Whenever there is an operation between a string and a number, the number will be converted to string automatically i.e coercion.

25. '+' operator will convert numbers into string, but in '-' case it will convert string into number exactly the opposite of '+' operator.

26. In Loose equality operator, type coercion is done automatically.
