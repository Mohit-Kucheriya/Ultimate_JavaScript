/*

1. Call Method -

In JavaScript, functions are reusable, and they depend on the value of 'this' 
(the object they are "called on"). Normally, 'this' is automatically determined 
by how a function is called. But what if you want to use a function with a different 
object? Thatâ€™s where call() helps.

Syntax -
functionName.call(object, arg1, arg2, ...);

- functionName: The function you want to invoke.

- object: The object to be used as 'this' inside the function.

- arg1, arg2, ...: Arguments passed to the function (if needed).

NOTE - Remember that the properties name in the other object should be the same as inisde the function,
otherwise it will not work.
